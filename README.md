Between consecutive frames code uses functions such as ORB to determine keypoints in images and using these keypoints code uses matrixes to
determine the magnitude of movement to classify the movement
Movement Categories : Camera or Object
when code determines which type it returns the movement type and frames

To run the app locally: install the requirements
go to the camera-movement-detection directory and type streamlit run app.py in terminal

## Local Development
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Technologies Used
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- NumPy
